## Wiring

Wiring is extremely important in FTC, but is often overlooked or hastily done the hour before competition starts. Wiring the robot properly is crucial to the performance and maintenance of the robot.

## General Advice

- Label wires so you know which wire goes into which port
- Tie together loose wires
- Use electrical tape on every wire connection
- Keep wires tucked away from moving parts
- Make wires as short as possible to reduce the risk of entanglement

## Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)

ESD can cause the robot to accumulate static charge and cause problems like disconnects. Therefore, it is important to mitigate the risk of an ESD event. ESD is caused by the triboelectric effect. For example, when you shuffle your feet on a carpet in wool socks and then touch a door knob, youâ€™ll likely get shocked. A robot's wheels moving on field tiles build charge on the robot frame just like your wool socks moving on carpet build charge on your body.

## General Advice
- REV Grounding Strap
- Wipe the wheels down with dryer sheets
- Anti-static spray
- Add ferrite chokes to signal wires
- Mount electronics on a non-conductive material like wood

## REV Hub Disconnects
REV Hubs have a tendency to disconnect. Generally, this is caused by the XT30 connectors wearing out. Over time, the pins on the XT30 connector of your Control Hub can become compressed.To remedy this, use flat-head screwdriver to separate the tines.  
Look at this guide from REV on how to do this:

You should also 3D print strain relief connectors on the Expansion Hub to prevent XT30 disconnects:
