# Exercises

1. Write a program that generates 5 random integers between 1 and 10 and stores them in an array. Use a for loop to fill each element of the array with a randomly generated integer. Then, use another for loop to output each element of the array. Additionally, the program should output the sum of the integers.  
Output:
```
5  
8  
1  
4  
10  
The sum of the integers is 28.
```
2. Write a program that prompts the user to input four integers and stores them in an array. Then, using a loop, the program should output the integers in reverse order.  
Output:
```
Please enter 4 integers.  
12 3 13 90 // User Input
90	13 3 12
```
3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of even integers they want to generate. The program should then output the requested number of even integers.  
Output:
```
How many even integers would you like displayed?
9 // User input
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18

```
4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence.  The program should output the sentence reversed.  Use an array of Strings that holds one letter in each spot of the array.  
Output:
```
Please enter a sentence.
I love junior Jellies! // User input
!seilleJ roinuj evol I
```
5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter some integers.  The integers should be stored in an array.  The program should output the 2 highest integers, first the 2nd highest, then the highest.  
Output:
```
How many integers would you like to enter?
7
Please enter the integers.
55 4 32 99 103 41 18
The two highest integers are 99 and 103.
```
