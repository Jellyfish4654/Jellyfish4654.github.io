# Exercises

1. Write a Java program that prompts the user to input the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle. Then, create a method that uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse. Your method should take the lengths of the two sides as parameters and return the length of the hypotenuse as a double.  

::: tip Output:
Enter the length of the first side of triangle.  
3 // User input  
Enter the length of the first side of triangle.  
4 // User input

2. Write a method that takes in two integers and returns their sum.

::: tip Output:
Enter two integers.  
9 10 // User input  
The sum of the integers was 19.

3. Write a program that asks the user to input a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. The formula for the conversion is: F = C * 1.8 + 32.

::: tip Output:
Enter temperature in Celsius:  
30 // User input  
30.0 degrees Celsius is equal to 86.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
