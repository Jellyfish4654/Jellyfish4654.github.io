1. Write a Java program that prompts the user to input the lengths of the two sides of a right triangle. Then, create a method that uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse. Your method should take the lengths of the two sides as parameters and return the length of the hypotenuse as a double.  

::: tip Output:
Enter the length of the first side of triangle.
3 // User input
