## Junior Jellies

Our team has thrived by organizing Junior Jellies, a student-centered afterschool program focused on introducing elementary and middle school students to [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) principles, including Gracious Professionalism and Coopetition. Our goal is to inspire the next generation in STEM and expand our community impact.
